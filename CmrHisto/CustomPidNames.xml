		Add your own pid custom text here.  Enter the PID name EXACTLY as it appears in DSDataViewer 
		in the "name" attribute, and the text you would like it replaced with in the "custom" attribute.
		For Example, the following rule would replace "RPM" with "Revolutions Per Minute" when the PID
		is displayed in CmrHisto:
		<pid name="RPM" custom="Revolutions Per Minute" />
